# Project Express API

This week I have created my own API using Express. The API uses data containing information about different books. In the server I have crated several endpoints that display books using different criterias. For instance the user can put in the authors name to view all the bokks written by that author.

## The problem

Before starting up this project I went throught Technigos material on Express and using endpoints. To easily display all the endpoints I have used the Express endpoint parser.

Due to the small size of the project, I didn't encounter any bigger issues. If I had more time I would try out using the API in an front-end project.

## View it live

The project is deplyoed using Render and can be viewed live here: https://project-express-api-7nzc.onrender.com

Note that the loading time can be a bit long due this:
"Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process.

Spinning up a service takes a few seconds, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running. For example, a browser page load will hang momentarily."
